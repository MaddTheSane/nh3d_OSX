fixes36.6 contains a terse summary of changes made to 3.6.5 in order to
produce 3.6.6 as well as any post-release fixes in binaries.


General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
invalid status highlight color could be maliciously used to corrupt memory
formatting corpse names used internal buffers differently from formatting
	other objects and could potentially clobber memory
avoid divide by 0 crash if 'bogusmon' (file of bogus monster types) is empty
avoid #wizrumorcheck crash if either 'rumors.tru' or 'rumors.fal' or both
	were empty when makedefs built 'rumors'
avoid "<mon>'s glorkum pass harmlessly through the shade" for weaponless mon
  

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes or Features
-----------------------------------------------------
teach unix/Makefile.doc how to make Guidebook.dat, an unpaginated copy of
	Guidebook.txt


General New Features
--------------------
none


Fixes to 3.6.6 Post-release Problems and other Post-release changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------
windows: added winflexbison to travis-ci configuration to permit full build of
	levcomp and dgncomp
windows: a bad chdir specified in win/win32/dgnstuff.mak caused full build to
	abort
windows: the console.rc file had outdated information stating 3.6.3 when the
	official 3.6.6 binary was built.
curses: cherry-picked selectsaved code from 3.7 for menu of save files
NetHackW: fix delay rendering of cursor when using farlook
during engraving, spaces were counted instead of non-space (cherry-pick of
	4e0a1e04 from NetHack-3.7)
avoid potential buffer overflow in append_str()
resolve missing dependency in NetHack.sln
code in include/tradstdc.h was trying to suppress warn_unused result by
	defining warn_unused_result to an empty string and that began causing
	a build error within a system-supplied header file cdefs.h when using
	ubuntu impish 21.10; disable that for any Linux unless GCC_URWARN is
	defined to force it back into effect
